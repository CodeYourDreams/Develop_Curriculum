    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a set of rules, instructions, and tools for building software applications. \n",
    "   Kind of like a messenger that delivers your request to the provider that your requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library.\n",
    "\n",
    "A user interface (the last part of API acronym) is how we as humans interact with an application. Interfaces are how we communicate with a machine, or how they communicate with each other. "

    "\n",
    "An API simplifies programming by only exposing objects or actions the developer needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "An API for a file input/outpu might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring the developer to understand the file system operations occuring behind the scenes. \n",

    "A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.\n",

    "### Three Written Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most API's require an API key. Once you find an API you want to play with, look in the documentation for access requirements. Most API's will ask you to complete an identity verification, then you'll get a string of letters and numbers to use when accessing the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The easiest way to start using an API is by finding an HTTP client online, like REST-Client, Postman, or Paw. These ready-made (and often free) tools help you structure your requests to access existing API's with the API key you recieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Build a URL. Each API is slightly different, so you need to review the documentation for the API you’re interested in. Most of the time, the documentation will include examples that you can tweak to get the output that you’re after.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: we want to tweak a given API to find 10 links to the Star Wars Wikipedia page. \n",
    "    http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=backlinks&bltitle=Star%20Wars&bllimit=10\n",
    "    \n",
    "    http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php — This is the place on the web where the API lives. Here, we’re using Wikipedia as an example, but you can replace this first part with the URL of any MediaWiki installation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    action=query — fetch the data requested in the rest of the URL.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    list=backlinks — list pages that link to a specific page.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    bltitle=Star%20Wars — the specific page with the title “Star Wars” (note that %20 represents a space).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    bllimit=10 — limit to 10 results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "API calls can return a variety of formats depending on the service. It may be helpful to start out returning the data in HTML or XML format that can be easily viewed in a web browser to make sure that you are receiving the correct/anticipated results. Later you can switch to another format that may be easier to download for other purposes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at another example.  Here is the documentation for Twitter’s GET users/show function, which returns all of the available information about a user, including description, URL, link to profile image, last tweet, count of friends / followers, and much more: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/get-users-show.html\n",
    "Again, you can simply modify the provided example query to return the information your interested in:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://api.twitter.com/1/users/show.xml?screen_name=geekygirldawn\n",
    "\n",
    "http://api.twitter.com/1 — Version 1 of the Twitter API.\n",
    "users — users section of the API to gather information on a user.\n",
    "show.xml — display the output as XML.\n",
    "screen_name=geekygirldawn — the user that you want information about (geekygirldawn)"

That makes it one of the youngest star forming regions in our sky, with newborn and embryonic stars embedded in its natal dust and gas clouds.
