    "    Pseudocode is a way of explaining code in a simplified way, without using real code. It is important to completely understand what you want to tell the computer to do before you start writing actual code. Pseudocode can be helpful in this way, to organize thoughts as well as have a visual representation of the program you are about to write. You can reference this pseudocode throughout the process of creating the project to see what tools to use for which parts, etc. "
