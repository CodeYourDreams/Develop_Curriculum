    "## What is Programming? \n",
    "   Programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what we want them to do next. Also called coding, it is a translation of our human instructions into computer language. The code is a way for the programmer to tell the computer how to solve problems or what tasks to perform. "

    "   Since computer science can be applied to so many different ideas, programmers are pretty free to design content to address almost any need. Programming is what makes our technology work the way we need it to. \n",
    "   Computer scientists design, develop, and test software for performance, reliability, and security. Coding is often very collaborative, so teams work together to plan, discuss, and invent each part of their projects. \n",

    "   Pseudocode is a way to organize your thoughts as well as your code, since it is a visual representation of what you plan to do. You can reference this pseudocode throughout the creation process to see what tools and strategies would work best for which parts."
