    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Code is read much more than it is written. The guidelines here are intended to improve the readability of your code and make it as consistent as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency is important, whether it has to do with multiple projects, one project, or one module/function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet it's also important to know when to be inconsistent - sometimes a style guide just doesn't apply. For example, if a guideline would make the code less readable, or following the style guide would be inconsistent with the surrounding code, it may make sense to break some rules. When in doubt, do your research and use your best judgement. And don't hesitate to ask! \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is based on John Mageeâ€™s Python Style Guide: simplified version for beginner programmers, which in turn was based on Style Guide for Python Code by Guido van Rossum and Barry Warsaw. The original version of Style for Python Code has been placed in the public domain by the authors and is available at: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. Any errors, omissions, or odious style conventions are on us."

    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each indent should contain 4 spaces, NOT one tab character.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check for this by trying this: in your editor, press the tab key and then press the left arrow key. If your cursor goes back to the beginning of the line, your editor inserted a single (incorrect) \"tab\" character. Many editors can be configured to insert four spaces when the tab key is pressed; google around for instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the cursor only goes back by one space (and you have to press the left arrow key three more times to get it to the beginning of the line), your editor is correctly inserting four spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Maximum Line Length\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. Many devices still limit their line lengths to 80 characters. Limiting line length also enables you to have multiple editors side by side. And automatic wrapping may disrupt the visual structure of the code, making it harder to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the preferred way to wrap long lines is by inserting line breaks inside of parentheses, brackets, and braces. In some cases, a backslash (\\) looks better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blank lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate functions and class definitions with two blank lines.\n",
    "\n",
