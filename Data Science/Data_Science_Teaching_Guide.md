# Code Your Dreams Data Science Teaching Guide

## Structure

### Skips

Since the Data Science curriculum is tailored to focus on skills more directly relevant to
data engineering, analysis, and visualization work, some material from the full Python 
curriculum cant be skipped. The following modules can be skipped if needed to make space 
for data science-specific modules:

- `11) Intro to Flask`

### Adds

The following modules contain the data science curriculum:

- `DS1) Working with Data`
- `DS2) Interpreting Data`
- `DS3) Data Visualization`
- `DS4) Making Predictions with Data`

To create a curriculum tailored to data science, these modules should be incorporated into the larger curriculum and existing modules be rearranged as follows:

- `01) Programming Components` through `06) Classes` taught as in standard curriculum
- Only cover `Intro to Packages` and `Intro to Numpy` in `07) Packages`, as Pandas is covered in the following DS1 module
- Insert `DS1) Working with Data`, `DS2) Interpreting Data`, `DS3) Data Visualization`, and `DS4) Making Predictions with Data`
- Finish with `08) Storage` as time allows
