# Code Your Dreams Data Science Teaching Guide

## Structure

### Skips

Since the Data Science curriculum is tailored to focus on skills more directly relevant to
data engineering, analysis, and visualization work, some material from the full Python 
curriculum cant be skipped. The following modules can be skipped if needed to make space 
for data science-specific modules:

- `11) Intro to Flask`

### Adds

The following modules contain the data science curriculum:

- `DS1) Working with Data`
- `DS2) Interpreting Data`
- `DS3) Data Visualization`
- `DS4) Making Predictions with Data`

To create a curriculum tailored to data science, these modules should be incorporated into the larger curriculum and existing modules be rearranged as follows:

- `01) Programming Components` through `06) Classes` taught as in standard curriculum
- Only cover `Intro to Packages` and `Intro to Numpy` in `07) Packages`, as Pandas is covered in the following DS1 module
- Insert `DS1) Working with Data`, `DS2) Interpreting Data`, `DS3) Data Visualization`, and `DS4) Making Predictions with Data`
- Finish with `08) Storage` as time allows

## Version 2 Draft Outline  (Business Intelligence x Data Science)
Prerequisites: Required background in basic Linux, basic Python, Pandas, basic HTML, basic CSS, Jinja2, Pipenv and Dependency management. 

Learning Objectives:
### Goal is to create a course in which a student learns how to hone in on a data project based on a client or user-centered problem, conduct data discovery and EDA, design a data science model, and determine a end user focused method for sharing that model with the user. 
- Matplotlib
- Dash / Flask
- Simple Deployment strategies 


- 1) Identify the question
    - example: 
	   - Pizza slices by the number
	   - volume of international travellers 
   
- 2) Finding the Data

- 3) Exploratory Data Analysis
- 4) Model Identification
- 5) Feature mining
- 5) Presentation 
    - Create an interactive Flask app to display data


- Future Ideas:
    - Image processing
