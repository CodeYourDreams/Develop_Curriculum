# Code Your Dreams:  Intro to Databases

This repo contains the materials for the Intro to Databases courses that are part of the [Code Your Dreams](https://www.codeyourdreams.org) curriculum.  

Each lesson is designed to have about 25 minutes of instructor-led learning and 25 minutes of hands-on lab exercises.

## Slides

Slides for both lessons are available in the same deck.  A downloadable copy of the slides is available [in this repo](Code%20Your%20Dreams_%20Intro%20to%20Databases.pptx).  If you do not have access to PowerPoint, you can access a published version of the slides online [here](http://bit.ly/cyd-slides).  Speaker notes are included in both versions of the slides.

## Troubleshooting

If you have trouble connecting to your database or are not getting any results when you try to access your database through Python code, be sure your current IP address is whitelisted.  Your IP address can change for a variety of reasons, so this is a good place to start troubleshooting.  See the [MongoDB Documentation](http://bit.ly/cyd-atlas) for detailed instructions on how to whitelist your IP address in MongoDB Atlas.
