    "# Intro to Databases: Setup for Lesson 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the *Code Your Dreams* **Introduction to Databases** course. This [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook covers the setup steps for Lesson 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up the **Introduction to Databases** course, you will need to create and configure the [MongoDB Atlas](http://bit.ly/cyd-atlas) account for your organization. Additionally, each workstation will need a copy of [MongoDB Compass](http://bit.ly/cyd-compass) installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MongoDB Atlas Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB Atlas has a context to where the databases resides. At the top level, there is an *organization*. You will want to create a separate organization for each class section, e.g. **Third Period - Fall 2019**, **Fourth Period - Fall 2019**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next level is referred to as a *project*. There will be a *project* created for each team of students in the class (*organization*). Each student will be assigned to a specific *project* (team) and the appropriate permissions assigned. For this step, you will need the student's email addresses to add them to their associated team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of each project will be a [cluster](http://bit.ly/cyd-cluster).  At a high level, a cluster is a set of nodes where copies of your database will be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MongoDB Atlas - Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Register](http://bit.ly/cyd-atlas-register) for a MongoDB Atlas account and agree to the [terms of service](http://bit.ly/cyd-atlas-terms).\n",
    "2. After registering for the first time, there will be a \"Build my first cluster\" splash screen. Exit out of that and hit \"Cancel\" on creating a cluster. We'll come back to that after the structure is set up for the class(es).\n",
    "3. At the **Clusters** dashboard, in the upper right corner of the screen, select your name and then from the dropdown select *Organizations*.\n",
    "4. Select the green **+ NEW ORGANIZATION** button and create a new organization for each class section. For this example, it will be **Third Period - Fall 2019**, and hit *Next*.\n",
    "5. Members will be added at the *project* level, so we will not add any members here. Click on **Create Organization**. Repeat steps 3-5 for each class section following the *Code Your Dreams* curriculum. \n",
    "6. With an organization in place for a specific class section, the next step is to create a new project for each team. Select the green **New Project** button.\n",
    "7. Give the project a name for the specific team of students, **Team 1** will be used in this tutorial. Click *Next*.\n",
    "8. This step is where you will need the students email addresses to invite them to a project and give them the appropriate permission level. Add the student's to the project via their email and set their permission level to *Project Data Access Read/Write*.The students will receive an email invitation to the proejct. Add all of this team's students to the project, then click the green **Create Project** button.\n",
    "9. It is now time to create the actual database cluster for the team. Click on the **Build a Cluster** button.\n",
    "10. Select the cloud provider of choice (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and then select the closest region to you that has a blue *FREE TIER AVAILABLE* designation.\n",
    "11. By default, the **Cluster Tier** should be set to **M0 Sandbox (Shared RAM, 512 MB Storage)**. This tier is free and is the one that should be selected.\n",
    "12. Feel free to change the **Cluster Name** to something meaningful like the name of the team's application. Be aware that this name _**CANNOT**_ be changed after the cluster is created.\n",
    "13. Make sure that in the bottom bar on the page the price says **FREE**, then click the green **Create Cluster** button.\n",
    "14. At this point, the database provisioning process will start. It typically takes less than ten minutes.\n",
    "15. Repeat steps 6-14 to create a project and cluster for each team in your class as well as yourself. You can begin the process of creating a new project by clicking the down arrow in the CONTEXT selection box and selecting **New Project**.\n",
    "    In the CONTEXT selection box, select the project you created for yourself.  You will use this project in the demos you do for the class. \n",
    "16. Now you are ready to get the connection string that will be used in [MongoDB Compass](http://bit.ly/cyd-compass). Make sure to follow the steps below to install this powerful tool. Click the **Connect** button in the *Clusters Dashboard* view.\n",
    "17. In the pop-up window, there are some security settings to configure. First up is to *Whitelist* your connection IP Address. Select the green **Add Your Current IP Address** button and accept the defaults. This *should* allow access to anyone inside your company's computer network. Your local Information Technology department may be able to assist if that is not the case.\n",
    "18. Next up is to create specific MongoDB Atlas users and assign passwords. This information will be used to connect to the database, and additional permissions can be set in the *MongoDB Users tab*. Remember the credentials you create as you will use them again in the next step. Click the green **Choose a connection method** button.\n",
    "19. We'll be using MongoDB Compass in this tutorial. Select the *Connect with MongoDB Compass* option, and *I have Compass*.\n",
    "20. Select the *1.12 or later* option from the version select box, then click on **Copy** to copy the connection string. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MongoDB Compass\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB Compass is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool for exploring and managing data stored in a MongoDB database. It is free to [download](http://bit.ly/cyd-compass-download) and allows users to easily import data into MongoDB. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "> As a reminder, MongoDB Compass needs to be installed on each workstation.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need to download the `ships.json` file from [here](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/CodeYourDreams/blob/master/ships.json) to be used as a sample dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MongoDB Compass Installation\n",
    "1. Head to the MongoDB Compass [download center](http://bit.ly/cyd-compass-download).\n",
    "2. Select the latest _Stable_ version in the **Version** dropdown.\n",
    "3. In the **Platform** dropdown, select your operating system.\n",
    "4. Click the green **Download** button.\n",
    "5. Locate and run the installer program that was downloaded and then follow the directions through the installation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MongoDB Compass - Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "1. With the connection string copied to the clipboard from the **MongoDB Atlas - Step by Step** instructions (above), open the MongoDB Compass application.\n",
    "2. When the program opens, a pop-up dialog box should appear saying that it has detected the connection string in your clipboard. Click **Yes** to use those settings inside MongoDB Compass.\n",
    "3. The connection information with the exception of the MongoDB User password is now filled in. Use the password from step 19 above and fill in the *Password* field.\n",
    "4. Name this connection to save as a favorite. For example, if you were connecting to the **Team 1** project, you could name the favorite *Team 1*. Then click on **Connect**.\n",
    "5. Click the **Create Database** button. For the *Database Name* use `ShipInfo`. For the *Collection Name* use `shipwrecks`. Leave *Capped Collection* and *Use Custom Collation* unchecked and click **CREATE DATABASE**.\n",
    "6. Click on the new `ShipInfo` database and then the `shipwrecks` collection.\n",
    "7. We can now load our own data into the `ShipInfo.shipwrecks` collection. From the *Collection* menu in MongoDB Compass, select **Import Data**. Select JSON and browse to the `ships.json` file you downloaded earlier. Then click **IMPORT**.\n",
    "8. MongoDB Compass will load the `ships.json` data into the `ShipInfo` database and it is ready to explore.\n"
