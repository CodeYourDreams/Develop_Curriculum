    "## Lesson: MongoDB Charts Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This portion of the lesson is intended to be executed live in front of the students.  The steps below will walk you through the demo.  Talking points are included in *italics*.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your browser and find the tab that is displaying Atlas.\n",
    "1. In the left menu, click **Charts**. *MongoDB Charts is a tool to create visual representations of your MongoDB data. You might use Charts if you want to display data from your apps to your stakeholders.  You might also use Charts to display data inside of your app itself.*\n",
    "1. *As you can see, I've already created a dashboard named My Dashboard.  A dashboard is a place where you can display one or more charts.  This dashboard is empty, so let's open it and add a chart.*\n",
    "1. Click **My Dashboard**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Map of the Shipwrecks\n",
    "1. Click **Add Chart**.\n",
    "1. *The first thing we need to do is choose what data we want to visualize.*\n",
    "1. In the **Choose a Data Source** selection box, select **ShipInfo.shipwrecks**. *Now we can see a list of fields I can choose to use in my chart.  Let's begin by creating a visualization of where the shipwrecks occurred.*\n",
    "1. In the Chart Type selection box, choose **Geospatial** and then click **Scatter**.\n",
    "1. Drag **coordinates** from the Fields pane and drop it on the **Coordinates** section of the Encode pane. *Now we can see a nice visualization of the shipwrecks.*\n",
    "1. Above the map, click **Enter a title for your chart**, input **Map of Shipwrecks**, and click the checkbox. *Let's give our map a title.*\n",
    "1. *Now that we have a nice visualization, let's save it.* In the upper-left corner, click **Save and Close**.\n",
    "1. *We want our dashboard to look nice, so let's adjust the size of the chart.* Drag the bottom-right corner of the chart to make it bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chart the Wreck Types\n",
    "1. *Let's create a different type of visualization.  Let's say we want to see what wreck types are the most popular.*\n",
    "1. Click **Add Chart**.\n",
    "1. In the **Choose a Data Source** selection box, select **ShipInfo.shipwrecks**. *Once again, we need to select our data source. If we had multiple collections, we could select a different data source here.*\n",
    "1. In the Chart Type selection box, choose **Circular**.\n",
    "1. Drag **feature_type** from the Fields pane and drop it on the **Label** section of the Encode pane. \n",
    "1. Drag **feature_type** from the Fields pane and drop it on the **Arc** section of the Encode pane. *Now we can see a nice visualization of the shipwrecks.*\n",
    "1. Above the map, click **Enter a title for your chart**, input **Types of Wrecks**, and click the checkbox. *Let's give our map a title.*\n",
    "1. *Now that we have a nice visualization, let's save it.* In the upper-left corner, click **Save and Close**.\n",
    "1. Adjust the size of the chart if you'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Now we have two charts on our dashboard.  We could add several more charts to this dashboard if we'd like.  We could then share this dashboard with our project stakeholders so they could easily see what is happening in the app.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embed the Wreck Types Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "*In addition to sharing the dashboard, I may want to display the chart in my app or on a webpage like a blog.  Today, I'll show you how to embed a chart in a Jupyter Notebook.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your MongoDB Charts dashboard, hover over the Types of Wrecks chart, click the Options button (**...**) in the upper-right corner of the chart, and select **Embed Chart**.\n",
    "1. *Some data is private and you will only want certain users to be able to view it.  MongoDB Charts has authentication options to help you keep your data secure. In this case, our data is not private, so I'm going to enable unauthenticated access.*\n",
    "1. Switch the **Enable unauthenticated access** to **ON**. #TODO add notes about how to do this the first time\n",
    "1. Copy the entire src url from inside the EMBED CODE. You should not copy the quotations. For example, the src url you copy should look something like **https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-team1-ximow/embed/charts?id=69fa82ce-d97f-4dc1-bc9b-404f8af7db6b&tenant=50e4d10e-b0a9-4e28-8c62-02c61b58f69a**. *If I were going to embed this in a webpage, I could simply copy this entire code snippet and paste it into my webpage. Since I want to embed in a Jupyter Notebook, I'm going to do things a little differently. I'll copy the src url out of the embed code.*\n",
    "1. Inside of this Jupyter notebook, paste the url in the code snippet below and run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Let's talk about what I just did.  In only a few minutes, I've created a nice visualization of my data and displayed it externally.  I didn't have to do any programming to make that happen.  Keep this capability in mind as you build your apps.  It might save you a lot of time to use MongoDB Charts instead of manually programming visualizations.*\n"
