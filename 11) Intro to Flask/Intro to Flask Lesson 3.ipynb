    "- A thank you page `thankyou.html` at `/thank_you` thanking users after competing the survey\n",
    "- A custom 404 error page `404.html`\n",

    "`WTForms` allows us to use any HTML form field type, such as checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. With `WTForms`, you can also _validate_ user inputs. Validating form data means verifying that the information submitted by a user suits what we're asking. For example, if we ask a user for a number, such as the number of lattes to order from Starbucks, we need to verify that the input is an integer, and not a string (`\"One Grande Latte\"`) or a float (`1.2` lattes). Validation can take on many other forms too, such as verifying that a user didn't submit blank information.\n",

We'll also _validate_ our user's form input by ensuring that the breed (a `StringField`) exists via `DataRequired()`. "
