# Code Your Dreams
## Code Your Dreams is a 501c3 non-profit that helps students build community focused applications from ideation to delivery.

## Our Mission 
Our mission is to amplify the voices of younger generations and embolden them to think critically, creatively and empathetically. We do this by by teaching our students how to build the applications they dream of for a better world. 

## Curriculum Overview
[![CYD Overview][overview-image]][overview-url]
## Usage
This repository contains the Code Your Dreams "Development" portion of its year-long curriculum for students. Topics of community and social justice are tied in with core computer science and Python topics across the curriculum. Take a look at this [Develop Curriculum Map](https://github.com/CodeYourDreams/Develop_Curriculum/blob/master/Curriculum_Map.md) for the curriculum structure.

Each core Module in the Application Development curriculum is numbered from #1 (Programming Components) to #11 (Intro to Flask). Modules #1-#11 are core classes that every Code Your Dreams student go through. After the final Module, #11 (Intro to Flask), the lessons that are taught are specialized toward the students' indiviudal application. For example, a map-based application necessitates different instruction than a chat app. See specific app folders for further instruction (e.g. Mapping Applications with Flask).
